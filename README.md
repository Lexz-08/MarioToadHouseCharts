# MarioToadHouseCharts
## Description
Displays all possible toad house powerup panels for Worlds 1-9.

## How To Use
Move the slider from left or right or to the middle to select a world (1-9).
Everytime the slider's value changes, the chart below the slider will change to the corresponding world.
Safe zones, highlighted in green, are basically things you can flip panels for that will "immediately" determine which chart you have.
